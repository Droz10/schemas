# STIX 

Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) is a collaborative community-driven effort to define and develop a standardized language to represent structured cyber threat information. The STIX Language intends to convey the full range of potential cyber threat information and strives to be fully expressive, flexible, extensible, automatable, and as human-readable as possible. All interested parties are welcome to participate in evolving STIX as part of its open, collaborative community.

Please visit the [STIX Web Site](http://stix.mitre.org) for more information about the STIX Language.

The STIX Language operates under the [STIX Terms of Use](http://stix.mitre.org/about/termsofuse.html).
